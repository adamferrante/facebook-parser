# facebook-parser
Parses exported Facebook JSON data.

This script goes through Facebook exported JSON data and pulls all the timestamps. This is useful to understand all the different timepoints Facebook has recorded about you.

This was created for a project to compare a Facebook Datagen vs Actual Facebook Timeplots.

TL;DR: School project, feel free to add more functionality. This would be a very cool timeline tool if developed further. Ain't ez.
